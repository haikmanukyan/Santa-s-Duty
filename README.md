# Santa-s-Duty
Santa's Duty is an indie game made in Unity. You play as Santa Claus (or even someone else!) and your duty is to distribute presents all around the planet. But brace yourself, it won't be an easy task! There are plenty of different creatures on every planet, that try to stop you from bringing joy to peoples houses! Sharpen your mind and find a way to make all the people happy, you're the greatest Santa after all!  Play through ?? different planets and ?? unique handcrafted levels, solving puzzles and giving presents. After that, train yourself in an endless mode, where you can play as long as you can.
